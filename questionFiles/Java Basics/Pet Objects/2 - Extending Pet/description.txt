We can use inheritance to represent divergent pet objects.

Take a look at the class 'Pet', which now has a new method named 'describe()'.

'Cat' and 'Dog' have both been updated to extend (inherit) from the Pet class, and therefore have access to Pet's describe() method.

Classes which extend other classes can over-write the behaviour of their parent class's methods. Over-write the class describe() in the Dog class, so it returns the following string:

Name: <name><br>
Animal: Dog

Where <name> is the name of the Dog calling the method.

Have a look at the Cat class to see how the describe method is implemented there.
