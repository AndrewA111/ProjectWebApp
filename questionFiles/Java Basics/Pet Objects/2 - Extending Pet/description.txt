We can use inheritance to represent divergent pet objects.

Take a look at the class 'Cat', it extends 'Pet', gaining all of it's properties. We can then include behaviour specific to the 'Cat' class (e.g. meow() method).

Considering the 'Cat', implement the 'Dog' class to extend 'Pet' and add another method names 'bark()' which returns the String "Woof!".
